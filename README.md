# qudi
Qudi is a suite of tools for operating multi-instrument and multi-computer laboratory experiments.
Originally built around a confocal fluorescence microscope experiments, it has grown to be a generally applicaple framework for controlling experiments.

## Installation of new core
First create a new environment with python 3.8 (>=3.9 is not yet supported by some packages 
we use) to install qudi and all dependencies in and activate this environment. 
### Using conda:
```bash
conda create -n qudicore python=3.8
conda activate qudicore
```

Create a new folder for the code to live in and change into it.
```bash
mkdir "C:\Software\qudicore"
cd "C:\Software\qudicore"
```

### Using native python:
Open a command line (e.g. cmd or powershell) in a location where you want to install the new virtual
environment and qudi.
Make sure to check if your default python executable is 3.8:
```bash
python -V
```
If the default python interpreter is a different python version, you need to substitute all calls to
`python` with an absolute path to a suitable interpreter\
(e.g. `python` --> `"C:\my_python38_dir\Scripts\python.exe"`)

Create a virtual environment using `venv` (you can also give it a different name than "qudicore"):
```bash
python -m venv qudicore
```
This should have created a new folder by the given name (in this case "qudicore") in the current 
directory.

Activate the new environment:
```bash
cd "qudicore\Scripts"
activate
cd ..
```

### Installing qudi as package
The next step is independent of conda or native Python once you created and activated the virtual 
environment.

Install the qudi package in the right environment and folder (see above) using pip. This also installs a qudi-kernel for jupyter notebooks (be careful, this might overright an already existing qudi-kernel).
```bash
python -m pip install -e git+https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi@core_pyside2_with_modules#egg=qudi
```

If you have created the environment with `venv`, the qudi repository will be checked out into `qudicore\src\qudi\`

## Running the new core

If you have followed the installation instructions above, the easiest way of running qudi is by 
command line (do not forget to activate the environment if this has not been done already):
```bash
qudi
```
Qudi takes several command line parameters. The most common for debugging and development is the 
`--debug` flag (only then debug messages are logged):
```bash
qudi --debug
```

If you want to run the new core in PyCharm, you need to open a project at the location where `pip` 
checked out the qudi repository (see above) and configure the project settings to use the Python 
interpreter corresponding to the `venv` or `conda` environment you just created.\
Afterwards you can run qudi by running `qudi\runnable.py` from within PyCharm (you can also pass the
same parameters to runnable.py).

## Citation
If you are publishing scientific results, mentioning Qudi in your methods decscription is the least you can do as good scientific practice.
You should cite our paper [Qudi: A modular python suite for experiment control and data processing](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2017.02.001) for this purpose.

## Collaboration
For development-related questions and discussion, please use the [qudi-dev mailing list](http://www.freelists.org/list/qudi-dev).

If you just want updates about releases and breaking changes to Qudi without discussion or issue reports,
subscribe to the [qudi-announce mailing list](http://www.freelists.org/list/qudi-announce).

Feel free to add issues and pull requests for improvements on github at https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi .

The code in pull requests should be clean, PEP8-compliant and commented, as with every academic institution in Germany,
our resources in the area of software development are quite limited.

Do not expect help, debugging efforts or other support.
